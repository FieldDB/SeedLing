The SeedLing API includes scripts to access data/information from:

* **ISO 639-3** : SIL ISO standards for language code (`miniethnologue.py`)
* **WALS**: Language information from World Atlas of Language Structures (`miniwals.py`)

To use the SeedLing corpus through the python API, please follow the instructions on the **Usage** section.
